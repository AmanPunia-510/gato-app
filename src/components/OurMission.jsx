Cafe Gatoâ€™s purpose is to alleviate the over-crowdedness of animal shelters to allow for more cats to be rescued and increase the potential of adoptability within the feline community, as well as boost mental well-being of those in our community who are feeling the stress of everyday life. Our core values are based around our community, making a difference, and the quality of our services and products.</p>
